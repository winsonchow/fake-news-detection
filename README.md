# Fake News Detection with NLP and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to tackle the growing problem of fake news by developing an advanced detection system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By analyzing textual data, the system distinguishes between genuine and fabricated news, contributing to the integrity of public discourse. This project was also serves as my capstone project.

## Features
- Utilizes Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn for development.
- Implements algorithms including Random Forest, Deep Learning models, and the Longformer model.
- Employs sentiment analysis and advanced feature engineering for improved detection accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises diverse news types, processed and balanced to train and test the models effectively. It includes rebalancing techniques like SMOTE to prevent model bias.

## Installation
Instructions on setting up the project environment, including required libraries and dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github/fake-news-detection
cd fake-news-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
